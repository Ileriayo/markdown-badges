# Contributing to markdown-badges

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

## The following steps are a set of guidelines for contributing to markdown-badges:

1. Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the existing repository. This will be your local copy where you can propose new changes.
2. Update the local clone or make changes directly on the forked repo, adding a badge with its appropriate hex-color in the given format:

3. Copy this markdown üëá

   `![Badge Name](https://img.shields.io/badge/<badge>-%23<badge-color>.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=<badge>&logoColor=<logo-color>)`
   
4. Replace the following: `<badge>` , `<badge-color>` , `<logo-color>`

    > **:fire: Important:** All of the badges are ordered alphabetically. Hence, while contributing, make sure to order to add the new badges in an alphabetical order.

    > **:bulb: Tip:** You can check available icons for your `<badge>` in [Simple Icons slugs](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/slugs.md) or [Simple Icons website](https://simpleicons.org/).

5. Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) with your proposed changes.

Yayyy, You are all done with the steps! Now just sit back and watch while your Pull request is reviewed and ultimately merged. üéä

## üñãÔ∏è When thinking of where to add your badge:
Favor general, i.e. widely known, categories rather than specific (sometimes unknown) categories, so that it is easier to find. For instance, when a person thinks of Tor Browser, they'd want to find it where other browsers are listed.

Similarly, we have several Google products (Play, Drive, Chrome, etc), however, they are not listed under a category for Google.

Think of the categories as `what they do` rather than `who they are`.
So, instead of a category titled **Google** for instance, Chrome would be placed in a category like **Browser**.

Having the categories based on `who they are` will quickly become clumsy. And clumsy doesn't feel right.

## üñãÔ∏è When your badge doesn't fit into any of the existing categories:
We've covered lots of ground and categories but if you find that your new badge doesn't fit into an existing category, create a new one. It would be lovely having a new category around. 

Some Guidelines for starting a new category:
- Check the existing categories one more time to be really sure your new badge won't fit into one. üòÑ
- Use a simple title. For example, instead of `Banks and money companies`, use `Finance`
- Use a title that obeys the `what they do` principle above.
- Place your shiny new category in the right alphabetical position.
