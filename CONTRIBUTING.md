# Contributing to markdown-badges

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following steps are a set of guidelines for contributing to markdown-badges:

### Steps:

1. Create a fork of the existing repository. This will be your local copy where you can propose new changes.
2. Update the local clone or make changes directly on the forked repo, adding a badge with its appropriate hex-color in the given format:

```
   ![Badge Name](https://img.shields.io/badge/<badge>-%23<badge-color>.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=<badge>&logoColor=<logo-color>)
```

Replace the following: `<badge>` , `<badge-color>` , `<logo-color>`

**Important:** All of the badges are ordered alphabetically. Hence, while contributing, make sure to order to add the new badges in an alphabetical order.

3. Create a Pull Request with your proposed changes.

You are all done with the steps!

#### Thanks again to ALL the amazing contributors!
